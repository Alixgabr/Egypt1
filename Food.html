        <h1>Egyptian food</h1>
        <p>Egyptian food is very delicious. Egyptian food is famous in Egypt is foul medames and green burger. I love Egyptians food very much</p>
        <p>The Egyptiansâ€™ relationship with food is a strong relationship that goes beyond its association with all Egyptian occasions only. Whoever refers to the Egyptian heritage will find that most popular proverbs contain mention of food, hunger, fullness, and some types of vegetables and fruits, and others contain kitchen items, indicating that food in general with all its contents is... The most prominent interests of Egyptians from ancient times.
